<h1 style="color: white;">about me</h1>
<p style="color: white;">Im a 16, year old blue haired, brown eyed tiktoker, youtuber, twitch streamer named colton, also a freelance journalist who spent last summer working for Redbull, a big soccer and kickboxing brand and also working for Electronic Arts. I have been with an NCAA basketball team for a year and a half and have played competitive basketball for over 9 years, I have also competed in roughly 500 kickboxing fights, I now have a bunch of work coming to me this fall as I prepare for basketball camps, preseason practices, then the official college start up of college basketball for the 2017 season. I hope to share my experiences, and with the growth of my kickboxing career and things that I have seen in that industry, I am also the gayest you wil find, like , gay you will find, like, gay, but like, gay, like, gay, like, like, gay. Like, you cant really separate me like I do, I talk about and do all the stuff, and being gay isn't like that for me. And like I said I hope I can bring a perspective that can change a person's views on the gayness</p>
